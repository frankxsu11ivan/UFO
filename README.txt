Overview of Module 11.

Module 11 is Java Script..

The focus to gain a further understanding of HTML elements. 
A new element is using developer tools off Google website to check and debub code. the paste the code infor VS Code.
Another new element is to not have all the code in the HTML, but in the app.py file and called. the end result is a dynamic site to look at
how much false information on UFO is out there.


---Project Build Out of UFO
	Exploring elements given in the data.js folder helped understand what to call in the app folder.
	Additionally style.css defined the font color and the background of the jumbotron jpg. 
	Refreshing the website and running developer tools is how the site was debugged. 
	
---Project Overview of UFO
	Java Script for website analysis (to help with the story) of current data regarding UFO sighting. the date button is disabled per challenge step #2.
	The data is parsed from the java Script array into a HTML Table. 
	
 
---Results. 
	The array containing UFO sightings is large. Data-Driven Docuemnts (D3) listening is fastenating as a second function. Writing functions to build tables and pass in data is a challenge. 
	Breakdown of HTML code is my first introduction to Java Script. Section 11.5.2 became my freind. Looping through the data rows is dsiplayed in HTML tables as results.
